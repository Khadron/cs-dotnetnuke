DotNetNuke is an open source web application framework ideal for creating, deploying and managing interactive web, intranet and extranet sites. It is very well supported, just take a look at snowcovered.com. Unfortunately, VB and C# programmers don't cooperate as best they should, and take a mutually exclusive choice between the languages. This is unfortunate because DotNetNuke is a very well developed framework for ASP.NET that a lot of C# programmers do not want to look at. In an attempt to open it up to a wider audience, we have converted the VB code into C#. Today, Oct. 28, 2006 we have released the first successful build in C#. Please support the authors at DotNetNuke.com for their work, and report bugs in the C# code base to us. To avoid forking the code, we will only update the code when a new release of the VB code.

2007-0607: Here we grow again. Jule Bostick has been added as a member to the team. He brings with him 5+ years of professional ASP.NET development. Welcome aboard. Aside from that, I will be updating a lot of fixed I've made to the code over the past few months including javascript errors, client api, and adsi membership modules.

2007-03-31: The project welcomes Jason Thomas, who has picked up my slack and was finally able to get it to load and run for the most part. He's still getting am still getting null
exceptions from many of the modules and invalid type errors in some some areas. But with his energy to the being brought to the team, I'll re-establish my interest and work with him and finish the conversion once and for all. Thanks to Jason everybody!
