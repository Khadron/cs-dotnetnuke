#How to build a working copy from SVN

= Creating a build for development from SVN =

Step 1:

Check out the project from http://cs-dotnetnuke.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
Step 2:

Ensure that there is an IIS ASP .NET website called CS_DNN_DEV defined, point this to \CS_Website within the directory that you checked out
Step 3:

Open the project (CS_DotNetNuke.sln) in visual studio and build it
Step 4:

A blank database and user needs to be created for DotNetNuke...

i) 	Open SQL server management express (or a suitable sql server management tool, instructions here are for SQL Server Management Express 2005)
ii) 	Right click on the databases tab and add a new database, I have chosen 'DNCS' in this case, press 'OK', to create the database.
iii)	A user needs to be created for the database, expand the security tab, right click on 'Logins' and create a new login
	
	Login name 'DNCS'
	SQL Server Authentication
		(enter a password and confirm it)...for testing purposes, I have chosen 'DNCS' as the password (to keep things simple)

	Uncheck 'Enforce Password Policy', 'Enforce Password Expiration', 'User must change password at next login'
	Default database [DNCS]
	English

	Click on 'User Mapping'
	Click the checkbox next to DNCS
	Click the db_owner checkbox

	Press 'OK'
	
Step 4:

	Adjust Web.Config to contain the correct connection string, typically this would be in a form similar to...

	server=WS028\SQLEXPRESS2;database=cs_dnn_dev;User ID=DNCS;Password=DNCS;Initial Catalog=DNCS

	The connection string is defined in two active confuguration areas, be sure to update them both (both can accept the same style of connection string)

Step 5:

	Visit http://localhost/CS_DNN_DEV/install/install.aspx to start the installer

	The installation should complete and you will be given a link to the main portal page...
