2007-01-06: Applied additional code updates, (see the change log in the svn repository), and have decided to tag the trunk to v4.3.4. I am now going to update sequentially to v4.3.5, v4.3.6 and to v4.3.7. The remaining bugs from the initial conversion (v4.3.4) will be found by you and reported so they can be fixed and merged into the trunk. Please post all issues now to the project's website here on google.com.
