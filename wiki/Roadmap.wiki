#summary Roadmap.

= Roadmap =

Bugs are going to be the biggest obstacle now. Theoretically i could upgrade to 4.3.7 today and be done with it, but would be any closer to a truly deliverable product? No, because we would still have those lingering bugs introduced from the vb to cs conversion. 

[http://www.flatburger.com FlatBurger] has already agreed to donate man power to quality assurance testing. But before they start I'm going to spend the next couple of weeks fixing the blatantly obvious functional bugs. That's when [http://www.flatburger.com FlatBurger] comes in. They're going to methodically go through the site and produce a list of as many bugs as they can. While they're doing that, I'm going to apply the code patches and update the codebase to 4.3.7. When they're done, I'll fix the list of bugs, and we should have a solid working product.
